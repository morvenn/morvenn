### Hi there 👋
Great to have you here! ❤
As you can see, a few years ago I did a bit of coding, but now I'm passionate mainly about technical content and documentation projects. Check out my latest projects with technical documentations - some I'm really proud of!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning DITA XML
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source docs project
